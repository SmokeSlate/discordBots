# SmokeBot Terms of Service

_Last updated: 12/8/2025_

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern the use of SmokeBot, a Discord moderation and support bot. By inviting or using SmokeBot in your Discord server, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not deploy or interact with the bot.

## 1. Eligibility and Account Responsibility
* SmokeBot may only be installed by individuals who have the authority to manage the Discord server where it will operate.
* You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and any applicable local laws.
* Server administrators are responsible for managing access to the bot token and the environment where SmokeBot is hosted.

## 2. Bot Functionality
SmokeBot offers ticketing, snippet automation, persistent pins, reaction roles, and moderation utilities. The bot processes Discord data only as necessary to provide these features. Configuration data is stored locally on the host machine as JSON files (`ticket_data.json`, `reaction_roles.json`, `snippets.json`, `pinned_messages.json`, `ticket_categories.json`).

## 3. Acceptable Use
When using SmokeBot, you agree not to:
* Violate Discord’s policies or any applicable law.
* Use the bot to harass, discriminate against, or exploit other users.
* Attempt to access or modify the bot’s source code or data files without authorization from the operator.
* Interfere with the bot’s operation, including attempting to overload, reverse engineer, or disrupt the service.

Server administrators should configure permissions so that only trusted staff can run moderation or configuration commands.

## 4. Data Practices
Details about the data SmokeBot processes are described in the [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md). By operating or using the bot, you acknowledge that the limited information outlined there may be processed to deliver the requested features.

## 5. Self‑Hosting and Availability
SmokeBot is typically self‑hosted. You are solely responsible for:
* Deploying and maintaining the hosting environment
* Installing updates and security patches
* Backing up or deleting configuration data as needed

Because operation depends on your hosting environment and Discord’s platform availability, we do not guarantee uptime, response time, or error-free performance. Features may change or be discontinued without notice.

## 6. Support
Support is provided on a best-effort basis by the maintainer(s). There is no obligation to provide assistance, bug fixes, or feature updates. Community contributions may be accepted at the maintainer’s discretion.

## 7. Termination
Server administrators may remove SmokeBot at any time by revoking its invite, deleting the bot token, and/or stopping the hosting process. We may suspend or terminate access to the bot (including blocking abusive instances) if these Terms or Discord’s policies are violated.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties
SMOKEBOT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. YOUR USE OF THE BOT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the maintainer(s) of SmokeBot will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of the bot; (b) any conduct or content of any third party; or (c) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or data.

## 10. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the maintainer(s) of SmokeBot from any claim, demand, loss, or damage, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use or misuse of the bot, violation of these Terms, or breach of any representation or warranty herein.

## 11. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. When changes are made, the “Last updated” date will be revised. Material changes will be announced through the project repository or release notes. Continued use of SmokeBot after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 12. Contact
Because SmokeBot is typically self‑hosted, contact the individual or team operating the bot in your server for any questions regarding these Terms. If you obtained the bot from a public repository, use the communication channels provided there.
